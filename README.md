# PyBer_Analysis

### Overview 
The purpose of this project was to analyze ride sharing data by city type utilizing the Pandas library and Matplotlib. 

### Results 
From the given data set, the total number of rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver were all calculated for the three different city types, rural, suburban, and urban. The results are shown in the dataframe below. Overall, urban cities had more drivers and rides, making the average fare lower than those in rural and suburban areas.

Taking a closer look at the total fares for each city type by week with the line plot below for data collected from January 1, 2019 to April 29, 2019, it can be seen that urban cities saw the highest total fares.

This is most likely a direct result of differences in population. Urban cities have a much higher average number of rides than rural and suburban areas, and rural areas have a lower average number of rides than urban and suburban areas. The box and whiskers plot below shows that the average number of rides in the rural cities is about 4 times lower in urban cities, and 3.5 times lower in suburban cities.
